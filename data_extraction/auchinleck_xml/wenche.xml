                        converted to TEI XML by Dr James Cummings of the Oxford Text Archive. The
                        notes below were taken from the header file and each HTML paragraph placed in

               <p>Short couplets. Ends imperfect with only 24 lines (barely
legible) remaining. Single letters remaining on the stub f.256ra
suggest at least 29 lines lost. Apparently an attempt was made to
erase the text.</p>

            <p>The Auchinleck Manuscript (NLS Adv MS 19.2.1) is one of the National Library of
                     Scotland’s greatest treasures. Produced in London in the 1330s, it provides a
                     unique insight into the English language and literature that Chaucer and his
                     generation grew up with and were influenced by. It acquired its name from its
                     first known owner, Lord Auchinleck, who discovered the manuscript in 1740 and
                     donated it to the precursor of the National Library in 1744.</p>
